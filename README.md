# Tab Hero

Tab Hero allows users to save a set of tabs, then restore that set of tabs later on

## Features

`Cmd+Shift+P` or `Ctrl+Shift+P` to access the menu
`Save Tab Set` saves all open tabs
`Open Tab Set` opens the saved tab set

## Release Notes

Users appreciate release notes as you update your extension.

## Known Issues

There is currently no persistance when you close VS Code.
When initially opening VS Code, only the focused tab and any accessed files after that are registered to the extension. So any files that are opened with background focus initially are not registered to the extension until they are given focus.
